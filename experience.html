    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <h3>Pharmacy Wholesale Store – Senior Employee (2 Years)</h3>

<p>I worked for 2 years as a senior employee at a wholesale pharmacy store, where I was responsible for managing stock, coordinating with suppliers, and overseeing the daily operations of the store. My duties included ensuring that inventory was accurate, arranging and labeling products correctly, and maintaining records of sales and shipments. I assisted customers with their orders, provided product information, and ensured that all transactions were smooth and efficient.

In this role, I also supervised junior staff, guided them in their daily tasks, and ensured that work was done efficiently and accurately. I developed strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities while handling high volumes of stock and managing multiple tasks simultaneously.

This experience helped me improve my leadership skills, teamwork, and customer service abilities. I also learned to communicate effectively with suppliers, staff, and clients, ensuring smooth operations and customer satisfaction. Overall, working in a fast-paced wholesale pharmacy environment enhanced my professional growth and prepared me for future responsibilities in management and operations.”</p>
